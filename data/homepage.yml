  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am a strange mix of science, art, and tech. I got my degree in biochemistry and then moved into the tech sector, first doing customer support and then working my way into a developer role. I went back to school for more biochemistry, but then decided that I liked tech better and made the switch back into the field.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My professional experience is all in backend web development, but I do have some experience with frontend development through some side projects I work on.
