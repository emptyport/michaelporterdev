## The project

My mother-in-law published a book in 2020 and I wanted to surprise her with a website for the book.

## The tech

I went with my favorite combo of Gatsby/TailwindCSS and built the site mostly from scratch (other than a few components here and there). The images in the Gallery are hosted from an S3 bucket via Cloudfront and are lazy-loaded as the user scrolls.

## What can be improved

The site serves its purpose pretty well. There are a few errors in the console related to the site icon that need to be resolved, but other than that the site is stable.
