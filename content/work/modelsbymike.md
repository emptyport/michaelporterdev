## The project

I'm an [Official Lens Creator on Snapchat](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/creator/Jn6NTlPetl3Iqtkd8MTNXQ), so I figured I should have a website to go along with it.

## The tech

I started with a Gatsby Tailwind starter, but completely gutted it and built everything up from scratch. I stuck with TailwindCSS for the styling and experimented with a little bit of neuomorphism. The contact form is processed by an AWS Lambda function and uses SES to email me the message.

## What can be improved

The site is becoming a little cluttered and a catchall for various things. I'm currently working on a redesign with a new color scheme and a tighter focus on augmented reality.
