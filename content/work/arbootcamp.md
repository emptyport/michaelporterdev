## The project

I love creating augmented reality filters for Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook and want to help others do the same. I created AR Bootcamp as a resource to help others learn how to create AR.

## The tech

I went with another Gatsby starter (an older version of the [Elemental starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/akzhy/gatsby-starter-elemental)) and made changes as I saw fit. I am committed to avoiding the use of cookies on my sites, so instead of embedding the newsletter signup form I am using a Netlify function to receive the form input and then create the contact in EmailOctopus via their API.

## What can be improved

There's a bit of duplication in the various layout files, I could probably consolidate most of it.
